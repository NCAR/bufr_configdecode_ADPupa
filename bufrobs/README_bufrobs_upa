README_bufrobs:

ds351.0 data files of the form, "gdasupaobs.<YYYYMMDDHH>.tar.gz"
should be copied to this directory.  After all desired data
files have been copied into "bufrobs", the user should edit and run
"exe/preprocess.csh" to prepare the data for use in the decoder
software.

After "exe/preprocess.csh" has been run, users should find a number
of files named "gdas.adpupa.t<UU>z.<YYYYMMDD>.bufr", "gdas.aircar.t<UU>z.<YYYYMMDD>.bufr",
"gdas.aircft.t<UU>z.<YYYYMMDD>.bufr", and "gdas.satwnd.t<UU>z.<YYYYMMDD>.bufr"
in this directory.  These are the individual BUFR data files.  Files with the suffix ".le"
are little-endian format, which must be used on Linux systems.  At this point the user should build a 
decoder configuration file (instructions and examples are found in the "configs" directory),
copy the configuration file into this directory, and execute the "../exe/bufrupprair.x" command
to extract the selected data from the input BUFR files.  Output files will
be written into the "textobs" directory.

**************************************************************************************
To run a software test, simply follow the above steps, leave the pre-staged 
"bufrupprair_config" in place, and decode the data found in the 
"gdasupaobs.20100901.tar.gz" file that has been pre-staged in this directory.
Output files will be written to the "textobs" directory, and can be compared with the
"ADPUPA.20100901<HH>print_US_def_sample" files pre-staged in the "textobs" directory. 
**************************************************************************************

To dump everything found in one BUFR file, the user should execute the "../exe/dumpbufr.x",
and follow the instructions.
