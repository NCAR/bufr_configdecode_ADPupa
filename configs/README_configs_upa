The "configs" directory contains a few sample configuration files which can
be provided to the bufrupprair.f executable.  When you want to try one of
these, you must first copy it to a file named bufrupprair_config.

To make your own, copy the bufrupprair_config_Guide_user file to a file
named bufrupprair_config.

When done editing a bufrupprair_config file, you must then copy it to the
...bufrdecode/bufrobs directory, i.e., where the data files are located, and where
bufrupprair.x is run.

The parameters to be extracted are identified by mnemonics.  If the set of
default parameters, defined in bufrupprair.x, is sufficient, you will not
need to know other mnemonics.  To add more parameters, you will need to refer
to a list, some of which are shown in the ..bufrdecode/docs/mnemonics.txt
file.  A complete list is available in the NCEP BUFR document:
http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/bufrtab_tableb.htm
It is possible to turn off the default, and obtain only what you want.

Here is a list of the sample configurations, and a description.

                                  800 and 100mb.
                    
bufrupprair_config_wbb          Gets only the SYNOP stations from the given
                                  WMO blocks

bufrupprair_config_wmo          Gets only the specified SYNOP stations


NOTE: All these configuration files use data file gdas.adpupa.t00z.20100901.bufr
      as an input.  Others may use one or more of the additional gdas files.  All
      files are already in the ../bufrobs directory, placed there as examples 
      when you untarred this package.
